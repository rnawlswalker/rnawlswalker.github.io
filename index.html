			<p>My name is Rebecca Nawls-Walker and I am currently studying to be  a web developer through the coding bootcamp at Northwestern university. I have always had an interest in finding out how different things worked and over the years I realized that being the annoying kid who would constantly ask why things worked the way they did had it's perks as I got older.</p>

			<p>In my current profession I consider myself to be a data curator. My job is to make information out of data that my unit owns or performs scrubs for and we use this data to provide key decision makers at our institution with what they need to be able to make decisions on behalf of the varies university stakeholders. While this work is fun and allows me to get into the details of the random bits of data we have, I'm really excited to translate my current skills and transform them into something that will allow me to answer more why questions.</p>
